# FinalProject
I will be modifying the main graphing class that we created to implement a few more searches, and a couple more options to the mix. Hopefully I will be able to learn about using the MapQuest API.

Edit:: MapQuest API never got fully working, my project is not as completed as I'd like it to be.

Utilizing the project:
You will need to download all files and run the main.cpp after compiling.

Should work on any C++ 13 or higher compiler.

There are no dependancies that havn't been accounted for inside of the code. Main uses are the vector and io packages.

Contributers: I was the sole contributer.

Bugs: I spent far too much time trying to work out the MapQuest API, and was unable to get it to work in time. It seems I was calling for distances in a manner that was incorrect, but I could not work it out, especially with finals.
